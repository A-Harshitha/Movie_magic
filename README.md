## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB instance for the database.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-random-secret-key>
```
- **`MONGO_URL`**: Connection string for your MongoDB database.
- **`JWT_SECRET`**: A random string used as a secret key for signing JWT tokens, which is essential for securely managing user sessions and authentication.
Sure! Hereâ€™s an expanded section on how to set up the `MONGO_URL` for your MovieMagic project.

### Setting up MongoDB and `MONGO_URL`

To use MongoDB with your MovieMagic application, follow these steps to set up your MongoDB instance and configure the `MONGO_URL`:

#### Option 1: Using MongoDB Atlas (Cloud MongoDB)

1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account**:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Once logged in, click on "Build a Cluster" and follow the steps to create a new cluster. Choose the free tier for a no-cost option.

3. **Set Up Cluster Security**:
   - Add a database user with a username and password.
   - Whitelist your IP address to allow connections to your cluster. Alternatively, you can allow access from anywhere (not recommended for production).

4. **Get the Connection String**:
   - After your cluster is set up, click on "Connect" and then "Connect your application".
   - Copy the provided connection string. It will look something like this:
     ```
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

5. **Configure the `.env` File**:
   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your MongoDB Atlas username, password, and database name respectively.
   - Add this connection string to your `.env` file as `MONGO_URL`:
     ```env
     MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     JWT_SECRET=<your-random-secret-key>
     ```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## CORS Configuration
Ensure that the client's URL is correctly set in the CORS configuration within `authRoute.js`:

```javascript
router.use(
    cors({
        credentials: true,
        origin: '<client-url>'
    })
);
```
Replace `<client-url>` with the actual URL of your client application.
